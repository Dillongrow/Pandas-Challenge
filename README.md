 In this scenario, I've become the Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district. In this capacity, I'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, I've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

My final report will include each of the following:

1. District Summary
2. School Summary
3. Top Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
4. Bottom Performing Schools (By Passing Rate)
5. Math Scores by Grade
6. Reading Scores by Grade
7. Scores by School Spending
8. Scores by School Size
9. Scores by School Type
